    western_affairs_movement:0 "Self-Strengthening Movement"
    western_affairs_movement_reason:0 "The defeat of our dynasty in the #variable Opium War#! shocked the court deeply. Once the most advanced and powerful country in the region, we are now surrounded by Western barbarians wielding #bold advanced weaponry#!. Our brave and loyal soldiers could not stand against the British forces, suffering a crushing defeat.\n\nIf we fail to recognize the urgency for reform, the downfall of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] looms on the horizon. Now, the leaders of [GetInterestGroupVariant('ig_intelligentsia',GetPlayer).GetNameWithCountryVariant] demand change, urging the court to study Western tools and technologies. Our Celestial Empire must first seek self-strengthening and subsequently pursue prosperity.\n\nIt is imperative that we set aside our pride, study their technologies, and achieve the goal of #bold learning from barbarians to counter barbarians#!."

    western_diplomatic_affairs_movement_reason:0 "Since our defeat in the #variable Opium War#!, increasingly frequent interactions with Westerners have forced [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] to compromise due to their #bold superior weaponry and strength#!, leading to the gradual collapse of the Celestial Empire’s #variable tributary system#!.\n\nThough Westerners have seized numerous rights, their ultimate goal is not to overthrow [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]’s rule. Thus, we can seek cooperation with them to quell internal dissent against our reign or leverage their conflicts for mutual benefit. However, our traditional #bold foreign affairs institutions and protocols#! are no longer suitable for managing relations with Western nations. Reforming our diplomatic system is urgently needed."

    western_industry_affairs_movement:0 "Self-Strengthening Movement: Develop Industry"
    western_industry_affairs_movement_reason:0 "“To strengthen [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], we must first develop industry. Without industry, self-strengthening cannot be achieved.”\n\nWestern firearms are not inherently terrifying, as our Celestial Empire has long employed firearms. Yet, Western firearms are finely crafted and produced at unmatched speed. To defeat Western nations, we must establish an industrial system capable of #bold manufacturing superior firearms#!."

    western_railway_affairs_movement:0 "Self-Strengthening Movement: Build Railways"
    western_railway_affairs_movement_reason:0 "Railways themselves are not extraordinary, being merely roads forged from iron. Yet the trains traversing these railways are indeed remarkable and practical innovations. However, trains cannot travel without railways. Western nations are enthusiastically building railways, and for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] to embrace the Self-Strengthening Movement, we must also #bold construct railways#!."

    western_army_affairs_movement:0 "Self-Strengthening Movement: Train Modern Army"
    western_army_affairs_movement_reason:0 "Throughout a thousand years of our #variable imperial examination system#!, numerous military talents and heroes have emerged. Yet today, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has no #bold martial scholars#! or #bold Banner warriors#! capable of mastering Western weapons or surpassing European military tactics. Western military strategies, despite their effectiveness, originally stem from the Celestial Empire.

    western_navy_affairs_movement_reason:0 "The #variable Opium War#! revealed the vital importance of a navy capable of undertaking #bold coastal defense tasks#!. In recalling the previous Ming dynasty's naval dominance, we see that our current navy, though superior to the Ming’s, still struggles against nations like [SCOPE.sCountry('GBR_scope').GetName].

    western_education_affairs_movement:0 "Self-Strengthening Movement: Westernize Education"
    western_education_affairs_movement_reason:0 "#bold Confucius said: 'Learning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous.'#! From its establishment, our dynasty has emphasized the imperial examination and scholars’ responsibilities of teaching and enlightenment. Yet, in recent years, the #variable imperial examination system#! has failed to produce many #bold practical talents#!, leaving the nation devoid of experts in Western technology. European nations' universities and public education systems are excellent, cultivating numerous talents. Our dynasty should follow their example and experiment with establishing modern academies."

    # Imperial Examination System
    imperial_examination_system:0 "Imperial Examination System"
    imperial_examination_system_reason:0 "Governance is like weaving a mat; it requires time to form. Thus, governance depends on capable individuals. Where they exist, governance thrives; where they do not, governance falters. The #variable Imperial Examination System#!, originating over a thousand years ago during the #bold Sui and Tang Dynasties#!, evolved through the Song dynasty and reached maturity during the Ming and Qing. It is a system designed to recruit talents from society through tiered exams, emphasizing the #bold Four Books and Five Classics#! to select capable individuals based on merit rather than heritage.\n\nThe #variable Imperial Examination System#! served as a bridge for commoners to ascend to positions of power and as a training ground for scholars to contribute to the nation. Throughout history, the #bold Imperial Examinations#! have brought countless talents to the forefront, leaving their marks in the annals of history, and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is no exception.\n\nSince #bold the Shizu Emperor entered the pass#!, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has harmonized Manchu and Han cultures, reflecting this integration in the examinations, creating a clear and unified governance. However, as Western knowledge spreads eastward, it remains uncertain whether the examination system will reach its conclusion or transform to lead once again."

    # Grand Council
    grand_council:0 "Grand Council"
    grand_council_reason:0 "The #variable Grand Council#!, established during the reign of #bold Emperor Yongzheng#!, began as a minor institution within the Forbidden City to address military matters concerning the Zunghar Khanate. Under the reforms of #bold Emperor Qianlong#!, its scope expanded beyond military affairs, encompassing all facets of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]: from the Six Ministries and the Nine Gates Infantry Command to the Bureau of Internal Affairs, the fifteen provinces, the northeastern generals in Fengtian, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, and the southwestern generals in Ili and Kashgar, extending to the borderlands and tributary nations.\n\nHowever, despite its importance, the #variable Grand Council#! cannot be compared to the #bold Three Departments of the Tang dynasty#!. The #bold Grand Councilors#! are not prime ministers and barely qualify as cabinet ministers, functioning more as the #bold emperor's private secretarial team#!. Consequently, if the emperor ever decides to abolish the council, the grand councilors’ sole option would be to #bold comply with the emperor's order#!.\n\nYet the times are uncertain, and with changing circumstances, the Grand Council may eventually undergo reforms to be revitalized for a new era."

    hundred_days_reform_reason:0 "The strength of European nations lies not only in their #bold advanced technology but also in their reliable institutions#!. Despite its position as a celestial empire, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is plagued by #bold bureaucratic corruption#! and #bold the autocracy of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle].#!\n\nIn history, Shang Yang abolished communal land and incentivized military merit to unify the Six States under Qin; Wang Anshi boosted production, strengthened the military, and reformed governance to rejuvenate the Song; Zhang Juzheng implemented the Single Whip Reform to stabilize a declining Ming. The path to effective governance begins with learning from past generations and #bold reforming existing laws and policies.#!\n\nFor the empire's survival, we must emulate these precedents, eradicate maladministration, and replace centuries-old autocracy with #bold new systems of democracy and scientific governance#! to meet the expectations of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s populace."

    hundred_days_reform_examination_reason:0 "Following Song and Ming traditions, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] selects talents through #bold Eight-Legged Essays#!. During Kangxi's reign, this format was briefly replaced by essay-style policy discussions but quickly restored. However, the outdated content and rigid format of the #bold Imperial Examinations#! no longer align with modern realities, rendering officials chosen through them ill-suited to manage [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s evolving internal and external challenges.

    hundred_days_reform_council_reason:0 "“The virtue of constitutional governance lies in clearly defining the structure and powers of government institutions, ensuring no overlap, and holding departments accountable for their actions. Today, China's greatest affliction is the entanglement of internal and external powers without clear distinctions. On the surface, roles appear defined, but in practice, responsibility is evaded.”\n\nThe #variable Grand Council#! lacks clarity in its jurisdiction, with #bold Grand Councilors#! numerous yet disorganized, serving as tools for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle]’s unilateral control.

Moreover, the influence of foreign missionaries has long been seen as a corrupting force threatening the stability of the realm.\n\nDuring the reign of #variable Emperor Shunzhi#!, a series of maritime prohibitions were enacted, forcing coastal populations inland and halting all trade to counter piracy from Japanese raiders. Later, #variable Emperor Qianlong#! strengthened these restrictions, concentrating all foreign trade exclusively through #bold Canton#! and placing it under the strict supervision of the #bold Cohong#! merchant guild.\n\nAlthough these measures effectively sealed off [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] from the outside world, smuggling and illicit trade continued to thrive. Nonetheless, the entrenched system of #variable isolation#! remains deeply woven into the interests of court officials and wealthy merchants alike.
