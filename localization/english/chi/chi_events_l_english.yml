     #Western Learning Spreads Eastward
    joi_flavor_chi.1.t: "Memorial on Strengthening the Nation"
    joi_flavor_chi.1.d: "Within the imperial court, calls for adopting Western technologies grow ever louder. A leading official has submitted a reformist memorial penned by the Self-Strengthening faction to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle]."
    joi_flavor_chi.1.f: "\"The nations of the West harness the collective wisdom of their people to promote agriculture, commerce, and industry. They strengthen their militaries through commerce and protect production with strong armies.\n\nA nation cannot be strong without a capable military; thus, we must drill our troops. Troops cannot be trained without proper funding; hence, commerce must flourish. But without capable men to manage finance and arms, talk of training and fiscal reform remains empty. Therefore, we must cultivate talent.\n\nWesterners excel in mathematics, natural philosophy, and mechanical arts. Their works are practical and well-documented, but only a tenth have been translated. Without reading the untranslated, we cannot reach their depths.\n\nThe Chinese are no less intelligent than Westerners. If we train scholars in Western languages and sciences, we can master the workings of steamships and firearms and find a viable path to national self-strengthening.\""
    joi_flavor_chi.1.a: "To strengthen the nation, we must first train the army."

     joi_flavor_chi.2.t: "Chinese Essence, Western Utility?"
    joi_flavor_chi.2.d: "As reform fervor spreads, debate over the role of traditional Chinese learning versus Western learning reaches the ears of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle]."
    joi_flavor_chi.2.f: "In every court hall and scholar’s residence, debate rages. The Self-Strengthening advocates argue Western science and technology are tools to support China's traditional order. To them, there is no need to reform the political structure — merely to adopt Western methods for wealth and strength.\n\nHowever, others argue for deeper change. Some even call for full-scale Westernization and a shift toward constitutional monarchy. What course should the Celestial Empire take?"
    joi_flavor_chi.2.a: "The traditions of Confucius are behind us; full Westernization is our path forward."
    joi_flavor_chi.2.b: "Our ancestors' wisdom remains the foundation of our realm."

    joi_flavor_chi.3.t: "End of the Self-Strengthening Movement"
    joi_flavor_chi.3.d: "Following the annulment of numerous reform decrees, the Self-Strengthening Movement has collapsed under conservative resistance."
    joi_flavor_chi.3.f: "The movement began with promising reforms, driven by capable ministers. Though lacking seniority, they showed virtue and diligence. But with foreign wars and domestic turmoil — from the Sino-French to the Sino-Japanese conflicts — the nation struggled. The Empress Dowager grew weary of governance, distracted by palace affairs.\n\nCourt politics became mired in factionalism. Despite loyal service by some, division endured for decades. Even the wise could not escape blame."
     joi_flavor_chi.3.a: "Why should the bountiful Middle Kingdom follow the ways of petty Western states?"

    joi_flavor_chi.4.t: "Conservatives Reject Western Learning"
    joi_flavor_chi.4.d: "During a routine audience, a leading member of the conservative landowning class delivered a fiery speech opposing Western influence."
    joi_flavor_chi.4.f: "\"Colleagues, surely you see: there is nothing noble in the Westernizers' ways; nothing civilized in the reformers' plans. Even peasants understand the threat of foreign foes. But if traitors corrupt our court, Heaven will punish them.\n\nOur ancestors forged ironclad laws through hardship. Shall we discard them? Western barbarians have won brief victories — should we mimic their stiff-legged ways that refuse to kneel?\n\nUnder Heaven’s order, the Middle Kingdom must uphold its sacred rites. Even if blood spills three feet, the dignity of the Confucian scholar must remain. I believe His Majesty is wise — merely blinded by villainous courtiers. Open your eyes, Your Majesty! See the wolves in your midst!\""
    joi_flavor_chi.4.a: "How could Western trickery rival our sacred teachings?"
    joi_flavor_chi.4.b: "We must still learn their industrial skills."
    joi_flavor_chi.4.c: "The growing wealth of our people will drown out the old voices!"
     
    #Reform and Modernization
    joi_flavor_chi.5.t: "The Role of Confucianism"
    joi_flavor_chi.5.d: "As the reform movement gathers pace, [GetInterestGroupVariant('ig_devout',GetPlayer).GetNameWithCountryVariant] begins questioning Confucianism's official status in the state."
    joi_flavor_chi.5.f: "To revive the nation and improve governance, we must draw from Western methods. While rooted in benevolence toward the people, both Chinese and Western systems share this ideal. Western laws, far from being without structure, often aim to enlighten the people and enrich their households. The most refined even seek to cultivate virtue and extend life.\n\nI have toiled day and night, seeking reform not for novelty's sake, but out of deep concern for my people. Our ancestors entrusted us with this realm — to govern well is to honor Heaven's mandate.\n\nYet foreign nations encroach on all sides. Without adopting their strengths, we cannot preserve our own. I grieve that the people remain unaware of my intentions — obstructed by unworthy officials and conservative scholars. Rumors confuse the common folk; even those in remote mountains know not of the reforms. Thus, I now proclaim my intent to the empire: let all subjects know their ruler’s heart, so that ruler and people may unite in restoring our great country."
    joi_flavor_chi.5.a: "It is what I have long wished for, though I dared not ask."
    joi_flavor_chi.5.b: "No! We cannot abandon our ancient roots!"

    joi_flavor_chi.6.t: "Conservatives Seize the Court"
    joi_flavor_chi.6.d: "In the early hours this morning, the Empress Dowager abruptly returned from the Summer Palace to the Forbidden City. She placed [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] under house arrest and issued a decree resuming regency."
    joi_flavor_chi.6.f: "\"Well, if it isn't Second Master! What brings you to the market today?\"\n\"Oh, you know... the Empress Dowager’s planning executions. Thought I’d come join the crowd.\"\n\"So those are the reformists? Huh... just like us, two arms and a head.\"\n\"Heh, that's people for you! Word is, even the new academies are shutting down... Hey Third Master, what’s got you at the market today?\"\n\"Sigh... my kid's sick. Doctor said you take a steamed bun, soak it in rebel blood, and he’ll be fine. You don’t get chances like this every day, so here I am!\""
    joi_flavor_chi.6.a: "Execute the reformists and display their heads!"

    joi_flavor_chi.7.t: "The End of the Imperial Examination"
    joi_flavor_chi.7.d: "Under the influence of the reformers, the thousand-year-old civil examination system was officially abolished during the reign of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle]."
    joi_flavor_chi.7.f: "These troubled times demand urgent reform. Officials clinging to ancient doctrines were previously ordered to study practical affairs and discard the habits of the Song and Ming dynasties. But true reform is vast in scope, complex in its needs, and must gather the wisdom of many.\n\nLet all ministers deliberate with open minds. Do not cling to archaic texts or bend the classics to personal gain. If you only appear loyal while resisting in truth, you betray the spirit of pragmatic governance — a betrayal I cannot tolerate.\n\nI know the pain of these changes. But if ruler and subject act with shared sincerity, the state will stabilize and the path to good governance will flourish."
    joi_flavor_chi.7.a: "Let us push forward in reforming the bureaucracy."
    joi_flavor_chi.7.b: "Widespread education is the key to a better civil service."

    joi_flavor_chi.8.t: "The End of the Grand Council"
    joi_flavor_chi.8.d: "After [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] reorganized the cabinet under reformist advice, the Grand Council nominally remained, but in reality ceased to function."
    joi_flavor_chi.8.f: "The Grand Council, created by Emperor Yongzheng, ended under his descendant’s reign. Gazing at its doors, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] recalled long talks with [SCOPE.sCharacter('chi_intelligentsia_leader_scope').GetFullName]. He wondered how his ancestors would judge him. Would he be called a wise reformer — or a misguided emperor? And what would the Empress Dowager think?\n\nMeanwhile, [GetInterestGroupVariant('ig_intelligentsia',GetPlayer).GetNameWithCountryVariant] leaders stifled their excitement. With careful calm, they planned the next steps. In reform, the dynasty may yet endure forever."
    joi_flavor_chi.8.a: "The voices of our rising elite must be heard."
    joi_flavor_chi.8.b: "His Majesty must tread carefully not to anger the gentry."
    joi_flavor_chi.8.c: "Faced with change unseen in five millennia, we must be bold!"

    # Closing of the Country
    joi_flavor_chi.9.t: "Commercial Regulations Signed"
    joi_flavor_chi.9.d: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has signed a new treaty with [SCOPE.sCountry('GBR_scope').GetName], granting favorable terms and allowing British officers to serve in the Imperial Maritime Customs Service."
    joi_flavor_chi.9.f: "\"Once goods are taxed, merchants from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] may trade freely. No additional tolls shall be imposed beyond standard rates. Inland checkpoints must not levy unauthorized fees — only the agreed percentage based on valuation.\n\nPreviously, collection was erratic, harming commerce. Now, all consulates will issue official documents to customs offices, ensuring clear tariffs.\n\nBritish merchants moving domestic goods to ports, or foreign goods inland, may pay tax once at a fixed rate of 2.5% per 100 taels.\n\nThis system simplifies trade, removing repeated inland fees while preserving maritime customs duties. The two structures shall not interfere.\""
    joi_flavor_chi.9.a: "It is merely the shifting of governance."

    joi_flavor_chi.10.t: "Conference of the Nine-Power Treaty"
    joi_flavor_chi.10.d: "Several [concept_great_power]s controlling [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s ports convene in [SCOPE.sCountry('USA_scope').GetName]'s capital to issue a joint declaration affirming neutrality and equal access in China."
    joi_flavor_chi.10.f: "The treaty powers agree:\n\n\"To respect the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]; to grant China full opportunity to develop a strong and stable government; to ensure equal commercial and industrial opportunity across all regions.\n\nNo power shall exploit China’s plight to seek special privileges or threaten the safety of other nations.\n\nChina’s railways must not impose discriminatory practices — all passengers and goods, regardless of nationality or direction, must receive equal treatment.\n\nNo matter the method of transport or ownership, nations shall be equally bound to fairness across all rail networks — present or future.\""
    joi_flavor_chi.10.a: "At least it offers some measure of security."

    joi_flavor_chi.11.t: "[SCOPE.sCountry('CHI_scope').GetName] Requests Customs Assistance"
    joi_flavor_chi.11.d: "The government of [SCOPE.sCountry('CHI_scope').GetName] seeks assistance from our seasoned customs officers to help administer their tariff system — with promises of profit in return."
    joi_flavor_chi.11.f: "\"The Chinese are a wise, industrious, and cultured people, deeply rooted in their own civilization. Their vast population of over 400 million lives within a fertile and resource-rich land. Mountains, rivers, valleys, and plains — every need of man is found here.\n\nYet after centuries of isolation and pride, they have been forced to enter treaty relations with the world. They see this as humiliation, and gain little from it. They now hope, someday, to grow strong enough to cast off all foreign interference and return to their former life.\"\n"
    joi_flavor_chi.11.a: "No, this would jeopardize our interests."
    joi_flavor_chi.11.b: "We must seize the opportunity to enter their customs service."

    #Xinhai Revolution
    joi_flavor_chi.12.t: "The Qing Emperor Abdicates"
    joi_flavor_chi.12.d: "This morning, the palace of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] could no longer withstand the pressure from the republicans. A decree of abdication was issued from [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName]."
    joi_flavor_chi.12.f: "\"Due to uprisings of revolutionary forces and the provinces rallying in response, the realm has fallen into turmoil and the people suffer greatly. I appointed envoys to negotiate with the revolutionaries, proposing a parliament and national referendum on the form of government. Two months have passed without resolution. North and South remain divided. Commerce has ceased, scholars wander homeless — as long as the national question remains unsettled, peace cannot return.\n\nNow the people clearly favor a republic. Southern provinces advocated first, and northern generals soon followed. The will of the people is the mandate of Heaven.\n\nHow could I, for the sake of one family's honor, defy the people's wishes? Thus, after examining public sentiment and the great trends, I, as [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle], hereby transfer the sovereignty of the state to the people and proclaim a constitutional republic. This comforts those who long for peace, and upholds the ancient ideal that 'All under Heaven belongs to the people.'\""
    joi_flavor_chi.12.a: "The Republic’s first task is to form a Parliament."
    joi_flavor_chi.12.b: "Proclaim the Provisional Constitution and reform the government!"

    joi_flavor_chi.13.t: "Homage at the Ming Ancestor's Tomb"
    joi_flavor_chi.13.d: "At 11 AM today, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle], accompanied by government leaders, paid respects at the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum. Reflecting on the Ming founder’s expulsion of the Mongols, he declared the Republic to be the continuation of that legacy — a great national victory."
    joi_flavor_chi.13.f: "\"Alas! Foreign threats have long plagued our land. In the late Song, China fell to the Mongols and suffered under foreign rule for nearly a century. Our Great Ancestor rose in that time, restoring the realm, renewing Heaven’s light, and reviving righteousness.\n\nBut in the dynasty’s waning years, corruption and exhaustion allowed the Manchus to seize China.\n\nFor 268 years, our fathers and brothers struggled to reclaim the nation. Now, in the year of Xinhai, revolution ignited in Wuchang and spread across the land. In just 87 days, seventeen provinces were restored. The people assembled and formed a provisional government in Nanjing.\n\nI, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], though lacking in virtue, was chosen as provisional president. I cannot yet fully repay the Ming Emperor’s legacy — but today, with the unity of our soldiers and the righteousness of our gentry, the Qing court has repented and abdicated.\n\nHenceforth, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is unified. Our people shall enjoy the blessings of liberty forevermore. This is the great mission continued from the Ming. Before I retire, I offer this joy on behalf of the people — may the Great Ancestor witness it from Heaven.\""
    joi_flavor_chi.13.a: "Expel the Manchus and restore China!"

    joi_flavor_chi.14.d: "Amid political turmoil, Zhang Xun, leader of the former Qing loyalist army, launched a coup in Beijing and attempted to reinstate the abdicated emperor in the Forbidden City."
    joi_flavor_chi.14.f: "\"With the plan set, court robes were brought forth. In solemn attire, the entourage entered the Forbidden City. It was around 9 AM. Over fifty officials joined — military ranks led by Zhang, civil ranks led by Kang. Zhang's aides followed closely. Among the officials were Liu Tingchen, Shen Zengzhi, Lao Naixuan, Gu Yuan, and Ruan Zhongshu.\n\nZhang Xun rode in a sedan chair to the steps of the Zhonghe Hall. The deposed emperor also arrived in a separate chair. Gu Yuan helped him down, and likewise supported Zhang.\n\nZhang wore a blue gauze robe and yellow vest. The emperor wore yellow silk robes and a red hat. They ascended the steps. Kang led the others in three kneelings and nine prostrations.\""

    joi_flavor_chi.15.d: "After securing power in Beijing, Beiyang warlord Yuan Shikai was formally petitioned to become emperor and announced the end of the Republic."
    joi_flavor_chi.15.f: "\"In May of the renzi year, out of compassion for the suffering caused by civil war, the people entrusted the provisional government to Yuan Shikai, hoping he would bring peace and rebuild the nation — an act of great virtue.\n\nBut what has Yuan given in return? The revolution cost countless lives to end Qing tyranny. Yet Yuan, even more tyrannical, seeks to crown himself emperor!\n\nHe has broken his oath, dissolved local councils, silenced the voice of the people, embezzled public funds, murdered patriots, and driven the Republic into danger. How can a nation survive this?\n\nIf the country falls, the people are enslaved. Only Yuan and his cronies will prosper. Alas, why did the people entrust the nation’s fate to this man?\n\nAs President, Yuan lets the people starve while songs echo through the capital. Does he still believe in the Republic?\n\nHe who pretends to honor the Republic, yet crowns himself king — is a traitor to the people! We who once supported him now vow to destroy him. Where justice leads, no obstacle shall stand. Let all patriots unite!\""

Whatever the cost, we shall fulfill our duty and uphold our principles, even unto death.\n\nWe call upon all citizens who believe in our ideals to support our army, join our fight, and help overthrow the warlords — only then can unity be secured and the revolution succeed.\""

    joi_flavor_chi.17.f: "\"Barely had the revolution begun, and already dissent arose within our own party. They said my ideals were too lofty, unsuited for China. Their voices spread like wildfire, even confusing our comrades. Thus, when I became President, my goals were less effective than during my time as revolutionary leader.\n\nThis is why our revolution has failed in construction. Overthrowing tyranny was easier than building anew. In place of one Manchu despot, many local tyrants emerged — bringing even greater suffering to the people.\n\nYet we must not forget: our revolution began with the goal of saving the nation and uplifting the people. That goal remains. If our comrades faltered, it is not solely due to selfishness, but often from error in thought and loss of will.\""

Today, the academy has officially been established. The principal, during the opening ceremony for the first batch of students in the Huangpu District of Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, delivered a speech and provided guidance. The academy’s approach will be fully managed by the principal, who will focus on improving military training, encouraging research on weapons and equipment, and fulfilling the founding father's directive to build a modernized military.

Will we unite for war, or for peace? If the former is true, this will align with the views of Chinese militarists and reactionaries, pushing for a Japanized China. If that happens, we may again witness the rise of Boxer-like rebellions in the world. But the creators of the Republic of China intended for peace, so I dare to state: we will use peaceful means to carry out this plan, which will be far more effective than using weapons to overthrow the Qing Dynasty.\""
