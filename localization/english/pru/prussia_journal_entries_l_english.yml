During times of war, the General Staff shall act as the supreme command's “sole advisor,” #bold devising strategies and tactics, coordinating military and materiel#!, and ensuring unified command over the military.\n\n2:#bold Introduce new wartime technologies#!. Update military equipment on a large scale, #bold develop powerful new artillery, and incorporate railways and telegraphs into warfare#!. Expand railway construction extensively to accelerate army mobilization and deployment, ensuring efficient troop movement and logistical support. Moltke believes: “Railways and telegraphs not only overcome past limitations of supply, season, and communication, but also enable massive deployments of manpower and equipment to the battlefield in a short period, creating advantageous conditions for strategic operations.”\n\n3:#bold Train General Staff officers#! to execute new wartime plans. The command shall prescribe only strategic objectives to army leaders, while the method of achieving these goals is left to their discretion — encouraging them to fully demonstrate initiative.\n\n4:#bold Intensify offensive tactics#!, “proactively considering politics, geography, and all aspects of the nation before action,” meticulously planning strategies in advance of wars, and adopting aggressive maneuvers once war commences.\n\nTo realize our ambitions, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has made the decisive choice to adopt #bold Moltke#!'s suggestions and implement reforms as per his proposals."
