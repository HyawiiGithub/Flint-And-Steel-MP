    #German Unification Plan
    joi_flavor_pru.1.t: "The German Question"
    joi_flavor_pru.1.d: "The thunderous victory over [SCOPE.sCountry('AUS_scope').GetName] at Königgrätz has set all German hearts aflame. From the cobblestone streets of Berlin to the university halls of Heidelberg, a single question echoes: What form shall German unification take? The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernmentName] must now decide between two competing visions that will shape Central Europe's destiny for generations."
    joi_flavor_pru.1.f: "In the gilded halls of the Berliner Stadtschloss, heated debate rages between ministers:\n\n\"Your Excellency, a Grossdeutschland including Austria and Bohemia would stretch from the Rhine to the Carpathians! But at what cost? [SCOPE.sCountry('GBR_scope').GetName] already eyes our rise with suspicion, and [SCOPE.sCountry('RUS_scope').GetName] would never tolerate such power at their border. We would stand alone against all Europe!\"\n\nA fist slams the oak table as General von Roon interrupts: \"By God! These are German lands! Would you leave millions of our brothers under Habsburg rule while French agents whisper in Munich and Saxon courts? The people demand full unification!\"\n\nThe aging minister rises slowly, his voice trembling: \"[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle], if you cannot support the true path of German destiny, then I... I can no longer serve this government.\""
    joi_flavor_pru.1.a: "„Ein Volk, ein Reich!“\nPursue Greater German Solution"
    joi_flavor_pru.1.b: "„Preußen über alles“\nAdopt the Prussian-led Lesser Germany"

    #Industrial Giants of Rhineland
    joi_flavor_pru.2.t: "The Ruhr: Forge of Empires"
    joi_flavor_pru.2.d: "The Rhineland has become the throbbing industrial heart of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], where forests of smokestacks now blot out the sky from Essen to Dortmund. The thunder of steam hammers and glow of Bessemer converters testify to our growing might - but greater ambitions still beckon."
    joi_flavor_pru.2.f: "In a smoke-filled Düsseldorf boardroom, industrialist August Thyssen gestures wildly at blueprints spread across a mahogany table:\n\n\"Herr Staatsminister, our new Siemens-Martin process will revolutionize steelmaking! Imagine - mills in the Ruhr producing steel at half the cost of [SCOPE.sCountry('GBR_scope').GetName]'s Welsh foundries! The site at Drendorf has perfect rail access and Rhine barges can deliver Swedish ore straight to our docks!\"\n\nThe minister fingers his watch chain skeptically: \"The Krupp works already supply our artillery... Why should the state fund your venture?\"\n\nThyssen leans in, his muttonchops bristling: \"Because, mein Herr, while Britain sleeps on her coal piles and [SCOPE.sCountry('FRA_scope').GetName] clings to her small workshops, we can dominate world steel! A modest investment now... and perhaps naming rights for our first blast furnace after our beloved [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle]?\""
    joi_flavor_pru.2.a: "Consolidate existing industries first - no more steelworks!"
    joi_flavor_pru.2.b: "Approved! Let the Thyssen-Kaiserwerk rise in the Ruhr!"
    
    # Compulsory Education Law
    joi_flavor_pru.3.t: "Education in Prussia"
    joi_flavor_pru.3.d: "From the landmark Generallandschulreglement of 1763, to the founding of the 'Aufbewahrungs-Anstalt für Kleine Kinder' — the first kindergarten in 1802 — and the pioneering school for the blind, deaf, and learning disabled in Berlin in 1806, Prussia has long stood at the forefront of public education. Now, with new schools flourishing across the realm, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] has signed into law a new compulsory education act, solidifying [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s commitment to nurturing an enlightened populace."
    joi_flavor_pru.3.f: "\"First, we #bold require that all citizens charged with the care of youth#! — parents, guardians, or overseers — #bold ensure their children#!, both boys and girls, attend school.\"\n\n\"Children must begin their schooling no later than the age of #bold five#! and continue without interruption until at least the age of fourteen. They shall attain literacy, numeracy, and sound knowledge of physics, chemistry, and political economy.\"\n\n\"All instruction must #bold adhere to government-approved textbooks#! to ensure proper mastery of subjects. Students’ progress shall be measured through standardized examinations.\"\n\n\"Those who distinguish themselves in scholarship shall be eligible for #bold publicly funded advancement#! to higher institutions of learning, that their talents may be refined for the service of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName].\""
    joi_flavor_pru.3.a: "Education shall, and must, be for everyone!"

    # Great Military Reform
    joi_flavor_pru.4.t: "Great Military Reform"
    joi_flavor_pru.4.d: "The sweeping military reforms have reached completion. General Helmuth von Moltke confidently assures [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] now possesses the finest army on the European continent."
    joi_flavor_pru.4.f: "\"The Generalstab is the very soul of our army. I have expanded its ranks and established new specialized departments. Chief among them is the #bold Eisenbahnabteilung#! — the Railway Division — which shall command the national rail network during wartime, bypassing civilian control to ensure rapid mobilization.\"\n\n\"Where once monarchs personally led armies, modern warfare demands otherwise. Henceforth, the #bold Chief of the General Staff#! shall assume supreme command of the army's operations.\"\n\n\"We have also introduced revolutionary new weaponry into our forces — innovations unparalleled anywhere in Europe. Critics call them costly and impractical, but [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] must not fear progress. Instead, we must #bold prioritize military budgets#! and focus relentlessly on #bold modernizing our armaments#!.\""
    joi_flavor_pru.4.a: "From now on, the Chief of the General Staff shall command mobilized forces directly."

    # Watch on the Rhine
    joi_flavor_pru.5.t: "Die Wacht am Rhein"
    joi_flavor_pru.5.d: "Recent claims by [SCOPE.sCountry('FRA_scope').GetName] advocating for the so-called 'natural borders' along the Rhine have stirred outrage throughout the German lands. In response, the poet Max Schneckenberger penned the stirring verses of 'Die Wacht am Rhein' — a patriotic hymn that has swept across the German Confederation, igniting fierce anti-French sentiment and strengthening the resolve to defend the Fatherland."
    joi_flavor_pru.5.f: "Es braust ein Ruf wie Donnerhall, Wie Schwertgeklirr und Wogenprall:;\nZum Rhein, zum Rhein, zum deutschen Rhein!\nWer will des Stromes Hüter sein?\n#bold Lieb’ Vaterland, magst ruhig sein, Fest steht und treu die Wacht, die Wacht am Rhein!#!\nDurch Hunderttausend zuckt es schnell, Und Aller Augen blitzen hell,\nDer deutsche Jüngling, fromm und stark, Beschirmt die heil’ge Landesmark.\n#bold Lieb’ Vaterland, magst ruhig sein, Fest steht und treu die Wacht, die Wacht am Rhein!#!\nEr blickt hinauf in Himmelsau’n,\nWo Heldengeister niederschau’n,\nUnd schwört mit stolzer Kampfeslust: „Du Rhein bleibst deutsch wie meine Brust.“\n#bold Lieb’ Vaterland, magst ruhig sein, Fest steht und treu die Wacht, die Wacht am Rhein!#!\nDer Schwur erschallt, die Woge rinnt,\nDie Fahnen flattern hoch im Wind:\nZum Rhein, zum Rhein, zum deutschen Rhein!\nWir Alle wollen Hüter sein!\n#bold Lieb’ Vaterland, magst ruhig sein, Fest steht und treu die Wacht, die Wacht am Rhein!#!"
    joi_flavor_pru.5.a: "Und schwört mit stolzer Kampfeslust: „Du Rhein bleibst deutsch wie meine Brust.“"
    joi_flavor_pru.5.b: "Lieb’ Vaterland, magst ruhig sein, Fest steht und treu die Wacht, die Wacht am Rhein!"
