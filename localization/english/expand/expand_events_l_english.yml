    joi_flavor_expand.1.d: "A meeting to discuss a new alliance agreement between Germany, Austria, and Russia held at Schönbrunn Palace..."
    joi_flavor_expand.1.f: "[SCOPE.sCountry('GER_scope').GetName], [SCOPE.sCountry('RUS_scope').GetName], and [SCOPE.sCountry('AUS_scope').GetName], driven by an equal desire to strengthen general peace through mutual understanding aimed at ensuring the defensive positions of their respective countries, decide to confirm an agreement reached between the three nations through special arrangements. The terms are negotiated by His Majesty the Emperor of [SCOPE.sCountry('RUS_scope').GetName], His Majesty the Emperor of [SCOPE.sCountry('GER_scope').GetName], and the plenipotentiary ambassador of [SCOPE.sCountry('AUS_scope').GetName]:\n\n1. If a contracting party finds itself at war with a third great power, the other contracting parties will maintain benevolent neutrality towards it and work towards localizing the conflict. If the contracting party finds itself in a defensive war, the remaining parties are obligated to join and assist the invaded side.\n\n2. Germany recognizes Russia's historically acquired rights in the Balkan Peninsula, particularly its overwhelming and decisive influence in Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia, as legitimate... Both nations commit not to make any modifications to the territorial status of the said peninsula without prior mutual agreement and oppose any attempts under any circumstances to disturb or alter the status quo without mutual consent.\n\n3. This treaty is effective for twenty years from the date of exchange of ratifications.\n\n4.

    #Abolition Event
    joi_flavor_expand.2.t: "Wilberforce's Successors"
    joi_flavor_expand.2.d: "Long after our suzerain [SCOPE.sCountry('GBR_scope').GetName] enacted the abolition act, under the witness of Prime Minister [SCOPE.sCharacter('prinimister_leader').GetFirstName], the slaves in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] were emancipated, thereby gaining freedom under the power of the '1833 Abolition Act.'"
    joi_flavor_expand.2.f: "Considering that various people were enslaved in His Majesty [SCOPE.sCharacter('gbr_king_ruler').GetPrimaryRoleTitle]'s colonies, it is just and proper to emancipate and release them all. Reasonable compensation should be given to those who had the right to avail themselves of such services, compensating them for the losses incurred by the deprivation of such rights;\n\nConsidering measures should be taken to promote industriousness and ensure good behavior among emancipated individuals for a limited period following their liberation; and considering the immediate necessity of amending current laws in said colonies to adapt to new circumstances and social relations following the universal emancipation;\n\nThus, promulgated by His Majesty the King and upon the advice and consent of the spiritual and secular Houses of Parliament and the Members of the Lower House, and authorized by the current Parliament:\n\nAt any time, with the owner's consent, all slaves brought into [SCOPE.sCountry('GBR_scope').GetName] and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], and thereafter all slaves brought into [SCOPE.sCountry('GBR_scope').GetName] and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] under similar consent, shall #bold enjoy absolute and complete freedom for any intent and purpose from the passage of this act onward.#!"

    #Frankfurt National Assembly: Beginning
    joi_flavor_expand.3.t: "March Revolution"
    joi_flavor_expand.3.d: "As the liberal revolutions spread across Europe, the radical atmosphere within the German Confederation has become unprecedentedly intense. Stirred by nationalist fervor, the [GetInterestGroupVariant('ig_petty_bourgeoisie',GetPlayer).GetNameWithCountryVariant] and [GetInterestGroupVariant('ig_trade_unions',GetPlayer).GetNameWithCountryVariant], organized by the [GetInterestGroupVariant('ig_intelligentsia',GetPlayer).GetNameWithCountryVariant], have launched a large-scale demonstration today demanding unification and freedom. Protests and riots have swept across [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName] has nearly been overtaken by protesters, and the government has lost contact with many major cities nationwide. Amid the current situation, even conservatives fear this may be a replay of the French Revolution, including the monarch [SCOPE.sCharacter('frankfurter_ruler').GetFirstName] [SCOPE.sCharacter('frankfurter_ruler').GetLastName] himself."
    joi_flavor_expand.3.f: "News of revolutions abroad spread to [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName]. Despite strict censorship, the first unofficial reports reached all layers of society in [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName]: unity, justice, and freedom. Many citizens gathered on the streets under mild and sunny weather, conducive to outdoor gatherings where political meetings could be organized. Coffeehouses became the meeting places for the educated middle class, linking distant revolutionary events with specific expectations for reform in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName].\n\nLast week, a small group of students gathered on the outskirts of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName], similar to foreign revolutionaries, aiming to summarize the people's demands and submit them as petitions directly to [SCOPE.sCharacter('frankfurter_ruler').GetPrimaryRoleTitle]. Their meeting achieved no agreement and ended inconclusively; however, it attracted many [GetInterestGroupVariant('ig_petty_bourgeoisie',GetPlayer).GetNameWithCountryVariant], even drawing sympathy and sponsorship from [GetInterestGroupVariant('ig_industrialists',GetPlayer).GetNameWithCountryVariant].\n\nWhen [SCOPE.sCharacter('frankfurter_ruler').GetFirstName][SCOPE.sCharacter('frankfurter_ruler').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] refused to accept the delegation's petition, the situation escalated. Angry citizens armed themselves and barricaded streets, with paving stones, wool sacks, and beams filling the gaps. Although soldiers managed to dismantle some barricades, mangled bodies strengthened the revolutionaries' resolve: the city echoed with church bells rallying more citizens for resistance. The riots became uncontrollable and spread nationwide, forcing [SCOPE.sCharacter('frankfurter_ruler').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] and his government to retreat to army-controlled city centers as police defected. [SCOPE.sCharacter('frankfurter_ruler').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] ultimately conceded, declaring #bold 'to place himself and the people under the ancient flag of the German Empire and incorporate [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] into Germany.'#!"
    joi_flavor_expand.3.a: "Germany is awakening, and all efforts are directed toward restoring German unification: demand that all Confederation members send representatives to participate!"
    joi_flavor_expand.3.b: "We have no choice but to accept the revolutionaries' demands; let [SCOPE.sCharacter('frankfurter_leader').GetFirstName] represent our nation."

    #Frankfurt Constitution and Dissolution of the Assembly
    joi_flavor_expand.4.t: "St. Paul's Constitution"
    joi_flavor_expand.4.d: "After prolonged debates and resolutions, as well as [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s decisive victory on the battlefield, the opposition within the Confederation finally capitulated. The Frankfurt Assembly officially crowned [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName][ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] as Emperor at Aachen Cathedral, a unified constitution was enacted and formally signed into effect. Today, the assembly announced to the world: the German nation, divided for centuries, has been reunited, and the ancient crown once belonging to the #variable German Kings, Emperors of the Romans#! has been restored upon the head of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName][ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle], who ascended the throne once occupied by Charlemagne. The entire German nation is cheering for the coronation of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle]!"
    joi_flavor_expand.4.f: "“[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is composed of the territories of the former German Confederation. Only German citizens can be appointed as officials in state governments and administrative departments. The Imperial Constitution and laws are equally binding across these states. Within the limits of the Imperial Constitution, German states retain their autonomy. The princes of the states keep their honors, but territorial sovereignty is transferred to the Imperial Government.”\n\n“The power of war and peace belongs exclusively to the Empire. All armed forces are directed by imperial authorities. The crown holds exclusive authority over the legislation and organization of military affairs, and oaths of loyalty must first include an obligation to the Imperial Head of State and the Imperial Constitution.”\n\n“The German Empire shall establish a customs and trade zone surrounded by shared customs borders, eliminating all internal tariffs. States cannot levy tariffs on goods entering or leaving German borders. The imperial power alone legislates trade, shipping, and industrial laws, and grants patents solely under imperial law.”\n\n“The Imperial Government has the right to regulate banking and currency issuance through imperial legislation. All expenses and institutions implemented through imperial means shall be borne by imperial resources. The Imperial Government is responsible for safeguarding the rights granted to all Germans by the Imperial Constitution. The crown shall maintain peace in the Empire and take necessary measures to ensure internal security and order.”"
    joi_flavor_expand.4.a: "Unity, Justice, and Freedom: All for the German Homeland!"
    joi_flavor_expand.5.t: "Dissolution of the Frankfurt Assembly"
    joi_flavor_expand.5.d: "The efforts for German unification and freedom ultimately ended in failure, and the traditional order was restored in Germany. The Frankfurt National Assembly, born from the revolution, declared its dissolution. After St. Paul's Church was seized by the military, the previously disbanded German Confederation was reorganized, and the authority of the monarchs was reestablished. The remaining assembly members scattered, with some coming to our nation and others fleeing abroad."
    joi_flavor_expand.5.f: "“The Regent Grand Duke has repeatedly expressed his desire to relinquish his dignity and return the power granted to him under federal laws to all members of the German Confederation... According to the agreement, in order to uphold the purpose of the Confederation as an international union of German princes and free cities, maintain the independence and inviolability of the states within the Confederation, and ensure Germany's internal and external security, a resolution was made to annul the validity of the temporary constitution.”\n\n“The affairs previously managed by the German Provisional Central Government that fall within the jurisdiction of the Federal Commission under Confederation laws shall be transferred to the Federal Commission during the transition period... Upon approval and receipt of the consent of the Imperial Regent Grand Duke, the Regent shall resign and transfer the rights and responsibilities granted by the Confederation to His Majesty the Emperor of [SCOPE.sCountry('AUS_scope').GetName] and His Majesty the King of [SCOPE.sCountry('PRU_scope').GetName].”"

    #Frankfurt Assembly Events
    joi_flavor_expand.6.t: "To My People and the German Nation"
    joi_flavor_expand.6.d: "Facing the growing fervor of nationalism, the conservative [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName] began to waver in their confidence on the throne. The legitimate heir to the throne, [SCOPE.sCharacter('heir_1848_scope').GetFirstName], delivered a passionate speech today outside the court to the zealous public, prompting [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] to consider whether to abdicate and pass the throne to a more popular successor to ensure family legacy."
    joi_flavor_expand.6.f: "“In the days of Napoleon's invasion, during the most perilous moments, I confidently addressed my people, and my confidence was not humiliated. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] united with his people, saving [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and Germany from disgrace and humiliation; today, as the homeland faces its greatest peril, I once again, with confidence, declare to the German nation:\n\nThe great German homeland is in internal turmoil and may face threats of external dangers from multiple fronts. Only under the leadership of one leader can this dual internal and external danger be overcome. And I—[SCOPE.sCharacter('heir_1848_scope').GetFirstName] [SCOPE.sCharacter('heir_1848_scope').GetLastName]—today assume the duties of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] to confront the dangerous days and assist the German nation, which I have loved and fought for throughout my life.”\n\n“The National Assembly convened days ago in Frankfurt is the means and legal institution to unite my people in saving and pacifying Germany. I intend to provide the princes and nobles of Germany an opportunity to hold joint meetings with the institutions of the National Assembly in a form that will be considered in detail immediately... Today, I have accepted the ancient German flag, placing myself and my people under the ancient banner of the German Empire.”"
    joi_flavor_expand.6.a: "Long live [SCOPE.sCharacter('heir_1848_scope').GetFirstName], [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] of all Germans!"

    #Draft of the Seventeen
    joi_flavor_expand.7.t: "Draft of the Seventeen"
    joi_flavor_expand.7.d: "For the purpose of creating a unified constitution for the future German Empire, the assembly representatives appointed a committee of seventeen widely recognized scholars, politicians, and priests to draft a constitution. Their results have been submitted to the assembly for voting today."
    joi_flavor_expand.7.f: "“Germany has endured the punishment of division for centuries; now it must realize the unification of its nation and state without delay before the second century after the end of the peace that made it weak. No force in the world is strong enough to stop a nation of over forty million people from deciding its own destiny from now on.”\n\n“The temptation of power resides in every heart, deducing the need to eliminate all outstanding greatness because it is an obstacle to freedom. Our royal family is bound not only by the ancient customs of obedience, which cannot casually be transferred elsewhere.”\n\n“If our multifaceted national life depends fundamentally on the continuation of German dynasties, then the imperial head of state governing the entire nation must be one who possesses the same hereditary rights. If humanity abandons this quality that is the root of all human power, the legitimacy of human power becomes unequal compared to those who recognize their obligation to place their hereditary power under sovereignty for the overall welfare.”"
    joi_flavor_expand.7.a: "The work results of the Committee of Seventeen provide no reference for the imperial constitution."
    joi_flavor_expand.7.b: "This sets a great precedent for the future imperial constitution."
    
    #Election Act
    joi_flavor_expand.8.t: "Federal Election Act"
    joi_flavor_expand.8.d: "Today, the assembly issued a resolution on suffrage and citizen representation in the assembly, requiring all member states of the German Confederation to organize elections among all adult independent men in each state to select representatives and dispatch them to Frankfurt."
    joi_flavor_expand.8.f: "“To accelerate the drafting of the foundation for the new federal constitution, the Federal Assembly, with the assistance of trusted public figures, has commenced preliminary work... To further advance this important matter, the federal government calls on its provinces belonging to the German national system to elect national representatives through constitutionally prescribed methods.”\n\n“Due to the urgency of the situation, the resolution temporarily adopts certain population standards for electing state representatives and requires each federal state to ensure one representative for every seventy thousand adult independent men, including states with insufficient population.”\n\n“These representatives will meet at the location of the Federal Assembly on a designated date to conduct constitutional work between government and citizens for Germany.”"
    joi_flavor_expand.8.a: "The so-called election resolution is not binding on [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
    joi_flavor_expand.8.b: "From now on, suffrage will be universal among all adult men!"
    
    #German Provisional Governmen
    joi_flavor_expand.9.t: "German Provisional Government?"
    joi_flavor_expand.9.d: "As the provisional constitution replaces the laws of the 1815 German Confederation, the assembly declared the establishment of a provisional central government in Frankfurt to handle German affairs before finalizing the constitution. However, the name of the provisional government and the future form of the state remain highly contested issues, especially among the left and right-wing liberals in the assembly."
    joi_flavor_expand.9.f: "“Before the ultimate establishment of German government power, a provisional central authority should be designated to manage all common affairs of the German nation... It shall exercise administrative power over all matters concerning the overall security and welfare of the German federal states; act as the supreme commander of the entire armed forces, particularly appointing the commander-in-chief of the armed forces; represent Germany in international law and commercial affairs and appoint ambassadors and consuls for this purpose.”\n\n“The formulation of the constitution remains excluded from the central authority's effectiveness, and the central government should strive to reach agreements with the authorized representatives of the states for implementation measures. Once the constitutional work is completed and implemented, the activities of the provisional central government will cease.”"
    joi_flavor_expand.9.a: "The glorious legitimacy of the German Emperor should directly originate from the Holy Roman Empire."
    joi_flavor_expand.9.b: "Germany should be a federal republic composed of member states and free cities."

    #General Bill of Exchange Ordinance
    joi_flavor_expand.10.t: "General Bill of Exchange Ordinance"
    joi_flavor_expand.10.d: "Bills of exchange are widely used promissory notes that can be utilized for international remittance, currency exchange, and even as an alternative currency. However, the German Confederation lacks supra-regional recognized legislation, relying instead on individual state and free city laws. In light of this, the assembly introduced standardized civil legislation yesterday to regulate acceptance, issuance, mortgage, and exchange of bills of exchange to further unify the German economy."
    joi_flavor_expand.10.f: "“Anyone capable of making commitments through contracts has the ability to exchange bills of exchange... The debtor on a bill of exchange is personally and financially responsible for fulfilling the obligations of the bill, and the issuer of the bill bears the responsibility for acceptance and payment.”\n\n“The holder of the bill is entitled to immediately present it to the payer for acceptance. If acceptance is refused, proof of refusal can be issued. Bills presented within a certain period after being sighted, if unable to gain acceptance, must have refusal certificates issued within the presentation period.”\n\n“Bills specifying a particular date for payment are due on the specified payment date mentioned in the bill. If the payment date falls in the middle of the month, the bill is due on the 15th of that month and must be recorded by a notary or court official.”"
    joi_flavor_expand.10.a: "Inform the assembly that given our country's economic issues, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] has decided to delay implementation."
    joi_flavor_expand.10.b: "The new bill ordinance will immediately be legislated and implemented!"

    #Simon-Gagern Agreement
    joi_flavor_expand.11.t: "Simon-Gagern Agreement"
    joi_flavor_expand.11.d: "Whether Austria could integrate into the German nation-state as part of the constitutional drafting in the assembly has become a seriously divisive issue. The assembly's interim Prime Minister #variable Heinrich Simon#! decided to establish a temporary agreement among factions to delay debates over Greater Germany, ensuring that drafting and voting on other constitutional sections can continue."
    joi_flavor_expand.11.f: "“The German Confederation government, in consultation with the Imperial Regent, agreed on a temporary arrangement whereby Austria and Prussia, acting on behalf of all Confederation governments, exercise central authority until a designated governing body can assume this authority.”\n\n“Members of the Federal Commission are tasked with dividing their responsibilities according to existing Confederation laws, particularly those governing warfare, executing their duties independently or under the supervision of His Majesty Emperor of [SCOPE.sCountry('AUS_scope').GetName] and His Majesty King of [SCOPE.sCountry('PRU_scope').GetName].”"
    joi_flavor_expand.11.a: "Coronating a German Emperor as monarch of the German Empire is paramount; Austria's issue can be addressed later."
    joi_flavor_expand.11.b: "If Austria is to join, the assembly must make concessions and adopt federalism."

    #Communist Manifesto
    joi_flavor_expand.12.t: "Communist Manifesto"
    joi_flavor_expand.12.d: "A leftist publication titled 'Communist Manifesto,' published in London, the capital of [SCOPE.sCountry('GBR_scope').GetName], has recently spread to the German Confederation. Even within the Frankfurt Assembly, many points raised in the pamphlet have been echoed by radical left-wing representatives. However, most are concerned about the 'collectivist society' described within and have requested [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName][ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetLastName][ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] to urgently ban this article, which undermines the basic social order of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
    joi_flavor_expand.12.f: "“A specter, the specter of communism, is haunting Europe. To confront this specter, old European forces—the pope and the tsar, Metternich and Guizot, French radicals, and German police—have all united.”\n\n“History to this day is the history of class struggles: freemen and slaves, patricians and plebeians, lords and serfs, guild masters and journeymen; oppressors and the oppressed always stood in opposition, engaged in unceasing, sometimes hidden, sometimes overt battles.”\n\n“Let the ruling class tremble before a communist revolution: the proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains and will gain the whole world!”"
    joi_flavor_expand.12.a: "The best way to counter communism is to improve social equity."
    joi_flavor_expand.12.b: "Strictly ban this pamphlet!"

    #Imperial Fleet
    joi_flavor_expand.13.t: "Imperial Fleet"
    joi_flavor_expand.13.d: "To ensure Germany's interests in maritime escort of merchant ships and territorial rights at sea, especially in competition with nations like [SCOPE.sCountry('GBR_scope').GetName] and [SCOPE.sCountry('DEN_scope').GetName], the assembly passed a bill to establish an Imperial Fleet for all of Germany, with its role, command, and funding specified in the future constitution."
    joi_flavor_expand.13.f: "“The first German warship has appeared and docked at the mouth of the Weser River, signaling to the many Germans there that they no longer rely solely on the despotic will of tyrants, but on the support of forty million people... The creation of our German Homeland Fleet is not merely a military or commercial matter but above all a national matter.”\n\n“Naval forces fall exclusively under imperial jurisdiction. No state may retain warships or issue privateering licenses... The appointment of naval officers and officials is entirely at the discretion of the Imperial Government. The requisition necessary for building naval ports and facilities, along with the authority designated to imperial agencies for this purpose, shall be determined by imperial laws to be issued.”"
    joi_flavor_expand.13.a: "Our glorious fleet shall be named the 'Reichsflotte!'"
    joi_flavor_expand.13.b: "The funding shall be used elsewhere."

    #Basic Law of Human Rights
    joi_flavor_expand.14.t: "Basic Law of Human Rights"
    joi_flavor_expand.14.d: "The assembly introduced a new bill on the political rights and human rights of German citizens, which is to be included as part of the future constitution. This bill has been distributed to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], where the people are celebrating enthusiastically, flooding the streets to demand its implementation by the government."
    joi_flavor_expand.14.f: "“The German people enjoy the following fundamental rights, which shall serve as standards for the constitutions of German states. No German state's constitution or legislation may abolish or restrict these rights:\n\nThe German people comprise citizens of the individual states that form the German Empire. Every German possesses the citizenship of the German Empire and may exercise their rights in any state of Germany, with the freedom to reside, settle, and engage in any form of livelihood within German territory.\n\nAll Germans are equal before the law. All non-job-related titles are abolished and may not be reinstated... Everyone qualified may equally hold public office and must equally fulfill mandatory military service and conscription requirements.\n\nPersonal freedom is inviolable. Except for arrests made on the spot, a person may only be arrested based on a judicial order specifying the reason. Police authorities must release detainees the next day or transfer them to judicial authorities. Except under martial law, punishments such as death, stocks, branding, and corporal punishment are abolished.\n\nPrivate property is sacred and inviolable. The seizure of letters and documents requires a judicial warrant, which must state the reason for the seizure and be delivered to the concerned person immediately or within the following twenty-four hours.”"
    joi_flavor_expand.14.a: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] will unquestionably follow the assembly's decision!"
    joi_flavor_expand.14.b: "We must consider the opposing voices within the government."

    #Imperial Regency
    joi_flavor_expand.15.t: "Imperial Regency"
    joi_flavor_expand.15.d: "As early as the enactment of the Provisional Government Authority Act, the law explicitly designated a 'regency' position to replace the 'head of state' in the Provisional Government, acting as the head of the German Empire's Provisional Government. However, due to disputes over this position among nations, the appointment has been delayed. With the constitution's progress and government functions improving, this position can no longer remain vacant, becoming yet another point of contention in the assembly."
    joi_flavor_expand.15.f: "“The temporary central authority belongs to a regent elected by the National Assembly... The regent exercises authority through ministers appointed by them, who are accountable to the National Assembly. All orders issued by the ministers must be countersigned by at least one responsible minister to be valid. The regent bears no actual responsibility. Legislative power resides with the assembly, while executive power is handled by the cabinet.\n\nMinisters have the right to participate in assembly deliberations and share their opinions... Ministers are obliged to attend meetings and provide information upon the National Assembly's request. Ministers may only vote if elected as members of the National Assembly. The regent's position is incompatible with membership in the National Assembly.”"
    joi_flavor_expand.15.a: "This position should belong to His Majesty the King of [SCOPE.sCountry('PRU_scope').GetName]!"

    joi_flavor_expand.16.d: "Today, representatives led by [SCOPE.sCountry('PRU_scope').GetName] and [SCOPE.sCountry('AUS_scope').GetName] began discussions in the assembly over the allocation of powers for new imperial institutions. However, the insistence of major powers on preserving their influence within Germany has led to a deadlock in the assembly."
    joi_flavor_expand.16.f: "“Who does the German Empire belong to? Specifically, to which country? The Emperor of [SCOPE.sCountry('AUS_scope').GetName], the King of [SCOPE.sCountry('PRU_scope').GetName], or even other monarchs? Even if this ruling position is merely symbolic?\n\nWhat does the German Confederation encompass? East Prussia? The Hungarian Crownlands? Italian territories? Austria hopes for this, but the Confederation’s members are unwilling to send troops to defend the Emperor’s private lands. If Vienna were to experience unrest, what would that have to do with Berlin, Munich, or Frankfurt? Vienna is the Emperor’s property, just as Schönbrunn Palace isn’t open to Vienna’s citizens.\n\nAnd who does the assembly belong to? Kings and dukes want as many votes in the assembly as possible, and so does the Emperor. How should the committee and cabinet be organized? Major powers only hope to turn these into yet another tool extending their influence and will, rather than a governing body for the German nation.”"
    joi_flavor_expand.16.a: "The German Confederation is intact; we can make concessions on powers."
