    ai_great_power_buff_reason:0 "The coronation of Queen Victoria in 1837 officially led the British Empire and the world onto the stage of the Victorian Era. Under the dazzling glory of Pax Britannica, the First Industrial Revolution was coming to an end, bringing an unprecedented boom in urban development.\n\nOn the European continent, the renowned Austrian Chancellor Metternich single-handedly constructed the Vienna System. Prussia, Russia, and Austria united to form a bastion of the old order, blocking the tide of revolution.\n\nThe suffering brought by the Napoleonic Wars had come to an end, and the compromises among the great powers brought a brief period of peace to the disaster-ridden European continent. However, although the flames of revolution were temporarily extinguished, the ideas of nationalism and liberalism remained vigorous. In this era of unprecedented technological advancement, people would begin to question beliefs their ancestors had held sacred for generations and forge new creeds."
