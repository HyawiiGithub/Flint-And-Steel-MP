    #Second Bank of the United States?
    joi_flavor_usa.1.t: "National Bank?"
    joi_flavor_usa.1.d: "The financial lifeline of our country—the Second Bank of the United States—stands at a historical crossroads: in May this year, its national charter will expire."
    joi_flavor_usa.1.f: "“Gentlemen! In fact, #bold the bank is but one of the results of a system whose operations are at odds with those of all our institutions#!; a system grounded in a political creed whose basic principle is a distrust of the people's will.\n\nPolitical power, whose great ultimate goal and inevitable consequence, #bold if it prevails, is to consolidate all powers in our system in the hands of a central government#!; massive public expenditures and corporations with exclusive privileges will replace the original and thus far sound balance of powers provided in the Constitution—through which #bold the few can control the political conduct of the many by silent and secret operations#! and acquire control over the labor and income of the mass of people; wherever this spirit allies itself with political power, #bold it bears the fruit of tyranny and despotism#!.\n\nIf employed for the purposes of government, it must constantly be watched, lest it corrupt the sources of public morality and trouble [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] with issues adverse to its harmonious pursuit of its true interests.”"
    joi_flavor_usa.1.a: "We must continue Madison's policies."
    joi_flavor_usa.1.b: "Let this institution go to hell!"

    joi_flavor_usa.2.d: "An investigative hearing is held on Capitol Hill to present evidence and debate a series of issues regarding the legitimacy and corruption of the current government."
    joi_flavor_usa.2.f: "“Mr. Speaker, the issues with this government have become very apparent; the recent scandal has spread across society. Today, we are raising questions to mitigate the effects of this scandal—that is, to force the resignation of ineffectual officials! The Department of Commerce and Trade will be responsible for new remedial plans…”\n“Your Excellency, I believe one must distinguish between intense political debate and unacceptable abuse, intimidation, and acts of violence; I implore Your Excellency, gentlemen should await the particulars in silence!”\n“Two Fridays ago, Your Excellency, you invited wealthy individuals supporting the government into your living room. May I ask Your Excellency, how you view these affluent donors providing tens of thousands of dollars in contributions?\n“Sir, your allegations against me amount to nothing more than conspiracy theories; hosting government friends is but common social interaction and does not constitute evidence of my corruption with the government.”"
    joi_flavor_usa.2.a: "This government is good enough."
    joi_flavor_usa.2.b: "Make them all resign, immediately!"

    #Congressional Impeachment Debate
    joi_flavor_usa.3.t: "Congressional Impeachment Debate"
    joi_flavor_usa.3.d: "Continuous anti-government riots and the infamous reputation of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] himself have ultimately led Congress to initiate impeachment proceedings against the current [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle][ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]."
    joi_flavor_usa.3.f: "“I must say, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] must resign immediately; it's evident that there are policy disagreements between [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] and his party. He has bred fantasies in his bunker that, unfortunately, have not been defeated…”\n“Indeed, Your Excellency, this administration has gone through some of the most challenging times in modern political history; we have also had to make some of the most pessimistic decisions, but I believe our major decisions were correct. This country is clearly leveraging its newfound independence to strengthen its natural advantages, making it the most suitable place to live and invest in the world.”\n“Listen, you, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle]! You lied to your ministers about what you knew and allowed them to repeat these lies to the nation until discovered! Even last week, you broke the rules, insisting that an opposition investigation committee could not be heard, and illegally promoted an ally to a senior government position!”\n“Yes, indeed, my esteemed Members of Congress, our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] has transitioned from one scandal to another, disgracing his office. He starts to drag everyone and everything down! Therefore, he is unfit for public office, untrustworthy for the government, and he must go!”"

    joi_flavor_usa.4.d: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle]'s claims ultimately lead to his downfall over the bank issue, and the bank's franchise receives a new round of approval by Congress."
    joi_flavor_usa.4.f: "Upon receiving local bank checks and notes deposited in the bank by government tax officials, the bank must constantly repay the required amounts to local banks for the checks and notes. It must do so because it can immediately provide these funds to the Treasury as needed. Since local banks settle in silver and gold coins, settlement pressure automatically adjusts local banks' loans: the more the local banks loan out, the greater the use of banknotes and checks, and the larger the amount they must pay; not settling in specie reduces their ability to lend."
    joi_flavor_usa.4.a: "The Union needs it."
    joi_flavor_usa.5.t: "Liquidation Act"
    joi_flavor_usa.5.d: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle]'s claims ultimately triumph, and the Second Bank is liquidated. From then on, the United States no longer has a government-controlled central bank, greatly enhancing the business scope of private entrepreneurs and bankers, #v $capitalists$#! cheer for the wise decision of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle]!"
    joi_flavor_usa.5.f: "“Late at night, we arrived in the city. Before going to sleep, I looked out of the window of my room and saw a beautiful white marble building opposite. Its appearance was ghastly, like a ghost, and looked gloomy. I attributed this to the sullen influence of the night. Rising the next morning, I again looked outside, expecting to see its steps and porch crowded with people coming and going. However, the doors remained tightly shut. The same cold, bleak atmosphere pervaded the building, as though only Don Guzman's marble statue could conduct any business within its gloomy walls.\n\nI promptly inquired about its name and purpose, and then my surprise disappeared. This was the grave of many fortunes, the underground tomb of investments: the unforgettable Second Bank of the United States.”"
    joi_flavor_usa.5.a: "We need to trust the judgment of the market!"

    #Civil War
    joi_flavor_usa.6.t: "The South Declares Independence!"
    joi_flavor_usa.6.d: "The turmoil caused by the issue of slavery ultimately leads the southern states to declare independence at a gathering."
    joi_flavor_usa.6.f: "“My paramount objective in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slaves, I would do it; if I could save it by freeing all the slaves, I would do it.”\n\n“If I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that. What I do about slavery and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union... I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty; #bold I do not intend to modify my oft-expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free.#!”"

    joi_flavor_usa.7.f: "“By virtue of the power and purpose vested in the Commander-in-Chief, I order and declare that all persons held as slaves within the rebellious states and regions are henceforth free and shall remain free forever; the government of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], including its naval and military authorities, will recognize and maintain their freedom.\n\nI also hereby enjoin upon the aforementioned freed persons to abstain from all violence unless in necessary self-defense; and I recommend to them that, in all possible cases, they labor faithfully for reasonable wages.\n\nI hereby declare and make known that suitable persons will be received into the armed forces of the United States, to garrison forts, positions, stations, and other places, and to man vessels of all sorts in said forces.\n\nWe are confident that this is a just action, warranted by military necessity and sanctioned by the Constitution.

We are met on a great battlefield of that war. For the sake of that nation's survival, we shall find our final resting place on this battlefield,—those who died for it have already done so.\n\nHowever, in a broader sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground; #bold those who struggled here, both living and dead, have already consecrated it#!, far beyond our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, #bold but it can never forget what they did here#!. Though the great task remains unfinished, those who fought for it have brought this endeavor to its final maturity. Undoubtedly, we the living must continue to dedicate ourselves to this cause.\n\nWe must devote ourselves to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion; #bold we shall not, we must not let those who gave their lives for it have died in vain#!; we shall ensure that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom; #bold and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.#!”"
    joi_flavor_usa.8.a: "All men are created equal!"
    joi_flavor_usa.9.t: "Rebuilding the Nation"
    joi_flavor_usa.9.d: "Though the military battles have ended, the struggle for the nation's spirit has not. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] must rebuild itself after being torn in two."

    joi_flavor_usa.10.f: "“Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as punishment for a crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], or any place subject to its jurisdiction...”\n\n“All persons born or naturalized in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], and subject to its jurisdiction, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws...”\n\n“Neither [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] nor any state shall deny or abridge the right of citizens of the United States to vote on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude...

    joi_flavor_usa.11.f: "“Around 10:25 PM, a man entered, slowly walking along one side of the 'Pierce' box. I heard someone say, 'Booth is there,' and I turned to look at him. He walked slowly, stopping near the box door, pulling out a card from his pocket, writing something on it, and handing it to the usher, who took it into the box. Shortly after, the door was opened, and he entered.\n\nI continued onward until I reached the east chamber and entered. There I encountered a sickening sight: before me was a coffin, with a corpse wrapped in mourning clothes lying atop it. Soldiers stationed around served as guards, while a group of people mournfully gazed at the shrouded corpse, some pitifully weeping. 'Who has died?' I asked one of the soldiers, whose reply was [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle]: '[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] has been killed by an assassin.'"

They were armed but lacked sufficient ammunition to overcome their enemies, who flanked them and continued to cut down dozens of African American defenders of the courthouse building. Even after surrendering their weapons, they were subjected to a horrifying massacre."

    joi_flavor_usa.13.d: "Reflections on the current state of society have sparked a widespread progressive wave, leading to a grand political movement."
    joi_flavor_usa.13.f: "“Predatory wealth—wealth accumulated on a grand scale through various forms of wrongdoing, including the oppression of wage workers, the suppression of competition in unfair and unhealthy ways, and deceiving the public through stock speculation and security manipulation. Certain wealthy individuals with these characteristics should be detested by anyone with a normal sense of conscience.\n\nThey have committed a terrible wrong by teaching our youth that extraordinary business success must often be founded on dishonesty, but they have succeeded in past months. Clearly, they have united in response. Their efforts are to overthrow and discredit all honest law enforcers, prevent any additional legislation to check and restrict them, and ensure unrestricted liberty that would allow every unscrupulous lawbreaker to act as he pleases.\n\nWith enough money, the people of these corporations and others engaged in the combinations mentioned above have amassed their vast fortunes in ways that can only be justified by advocating a moral system that legitimizes all forms of union crime, as well as all forms of violence, corruption, and fraud, from murder to bribery and political ballot stuffing.”"

Men wear neat suits with tilted hats, while women don fashionable dresses, arm-in-arm with friends, laughing and chatting.”\n\n“They sit at cozy outdoor cafe tables, enjoying freshly baked bread and fresh coffee, discussing the latest theatre performances or plans for suburban picnics.

Yet we are arrested or forced to stand before empty seats. If we do not take steps to stop these arrests, they will continue. Next time it may be you, your daughter, or your mother. This lady's case will be heard on Monday. Thus, we ask every African-American not to use public transit on Monday, to protest the arrest and trial. Do not ride buses to work, downtown, school, or anywhere on Monday. If you have no other way than public transit, you may take a day off from school. You may also spend a day away from downtown.

    joi_flavor_usa.29.d: "Due to the inefficiency of the current Senate, many reformists gradually begin to support comprehensive legislative reforms to address the issues presented to Congress with more foresight, ensuring the federal government has sufficient representation from all states and guaranteeing that senators are not overly reliant on popular support or present-day sentiments."
    joi_flavor_usa.29.f: "The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two senators from each state, elected by the people thereof, for six years; each senator shall have one vote. The electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislatures.\n\nWhen vacancies happen in the representation of any state in the Senate, the executive authority of such state shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies: Provided, that the legislature of any state may empower the executive thereof to make temporary appointments until the people fill the vacancies by election as the legislature may direct.\n\nThis amendment shall not be so construed as to affect the election or term of any senator chosen before it becomes valid as part of the Constitution."

    joi_flavor_usa.30.d: "A Missouri citizen named Virginia Minor appeals to the Supreme Court, arguing that the ruling by the Missouri Court of Appeals prohibiting women from voting violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution."
    joi_flavor_usa.30.f: "“From the adoption of the Constitution to the present time, the universal practice of almost all states has been to confine the elective franchise to males...and the clear intent of the Fourteenth Amendment was to grant citizenship to former slaves, not to compel changes to state laws.”\n\n“The second section of the Fourteenth Amendment specifically mentions male citizens and concludes: ‘This explicitly recognizes the right and appears to anticipate the states’ exercise of the right to restrict the elective franchise to male residents.’”\n\n“The Constitution adopts the qualifications prescribed in each state for voters of the most numerous branch of the state legislature as the qualification for electors of Congressmen; hence, the right is not expressly granted by the Constitution to any person or class of persons, as one must refer to state laws to describe the class...but the court does not mean to say that when this class or individual is so determined, his right to vote for Congressmen is not essentially based on the Constitution.”"

    joi_flavor_usa.31.d: "The increasingly intense anti-Prohibition movement sweeps across the nation, bringing forth the question of whether the Eighteenth Amendment's Prohibition should become the first constitutional amendment in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s history to be repealed."
    joi_flavor_usa.31.f: "“When Prohibition was enacted, I hoped it would enjoy broad public support and that people would soon recognize the evil influence of alcohol. Slowly and reluctantly, I have come to believe this has not been the result. Instead, drinking has generally increased; underground bars have replaced saloons; a vast army of lawbreakers has emerged; many of our finest citizens openly disregard Prohibition; respect for law has greatly diminished, and crime has risen to unprecedented levels.”\n\nTwenty-four Yankees, feeling their throats dry and bitter,\nCrossed the long border to the north to drink rye,\nWhen the rye was uncapped, the Yankees sang aloud:\n‘God save America, but also our King!’"
    joi_flavor_usa.31.a: "This impractical provision must be repealed."
