Their monarchs still hold court, their ministers still govern, merely paying lip service to our #bold 'German Emperor'#! [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle][ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName].\n\nThis half-measure cannot stand. To prevent [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] from degenerating into another #bold impotent Holy Roman Empire#!, we must codify a new imperial constitution - one that clearly defines the powers of the central government versus the states while establishing the empire's #bold fundamental political order#!.\n\nThe Reichstag must act decisively to cement Berlin's authority before pursuing other reforms.
