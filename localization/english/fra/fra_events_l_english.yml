    #National Assembly
    joi_flavor_fra.1.t: "Rebuilding the Assemblée nationale!"
    joi_flavor_fra.1.d: "Not seen since the ideals of the Révolution française sparked widespread change, the republican system has once again been brought back to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. The assembly established by the Third Estate, belonging to the citizens, has also been rebuilt, and it has been renamed after the organization that proclaimed the Declaration of the Rights of Man: the National Assembly!"
    joi_flavor_fra.1.f: "“Freedom, property, security, and resistance to oppression are inalienable human rights... Private property is a natural right, inalienable and inviolable.”\n“All men are born and remain free and equal in rights. Social distinctions may only be based on the common good... No one may be accused, arrested, or detained except in cases determined by the law and according to the forms prescribed by the law. Anyone inciting, dispatching, executing, or causing the execution of arbitrary orders must be punished; but any citizen summoned or arrested according to the law must obey immediately.”\nThe free exchange of thoughts and opinions is one of humanity's most precious rights... The safeguard of human and civil rights requires public power: hence, this power is established for the benefit of all and not for the private interest of those to whom it is entrusted.”\n“Arise, children of the Fatherland,\nThe day of glory has arrived!\nAgainst us, tyranny\nRaises its bloody flag.\nIt comes to your side\nTo kill your sons and wives.\nArm yourselves, citizens!\nOrganize your battalions!\nArise! Advance!”"
    joi_flavor_fra.1.a: "The assembly’s responsibilities should not exceed its limits."
    joi_flavor_fra.1.b: "Vive la République!"

    #Impeachment Debate
    joi_flavor_fra.2.t: "Impeachment Debate"
    joi_flavor_fra.2.d: "A debate regarding whether [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] is fit for their position was held today at the National Assembly’s venue: the Palais Bourbon."
    joi_flavor_fra.2.f: "“Nothing demonstrates this government’s incompetence more than [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] themselves!”\n“Scoundrel! Isn’t this shameless political opportunism from the opposition leader, prioritizing party interests over national interests? Isn’t he merely trying to hide his lack of policy on this major issue?”\n“We are a democratic nation, and our party will decide what policies we run on... The recent historic shameful failure is the result of governmental chaos and failure. Clearly, this government’s core plans on the nation’s most important issues have failed to garner support. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] has lost control, and the government has lost the ability to govern.”\n“Order! Members may intervene, but they should not scream observations across the chamber in frustration!”\n“Thank you, Mr. Speaker. However, as I have clearly stated, all precedents show that when a government experiences a failure like last night’s, it should resign and allow the people to elect a new assembly to address the nation’s challenges.”"
    joi_flavor_fra.2.a: "301 votes in favor, 299 against, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] is ousted!"
    joi_flavor_fra.2.b: "299 votes in favor, 301 against, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] prevails!"

    #Algiers: Tocqueville's Greetings
    joi_flavor_fra.3.t: "Tocqueville's Greetings"
    joi_flavor_fra.3.d: "The conquest of Algiers is complete; however, ruling Algiers remains a matter for Paris to deliberate upon..."
    joi_flavor_fra.3.f: "“#bold As you gentlemen know#!, Algieria stretches almost in a straight line from west to east, with a towering mountain range parallel to its shores, known as the #bold Atlas Mountains#!. At times, the Atlas Mountains retreat southward, exposing long and broad plains. Occasionally, they approach the coastline, bathing their last slopes in the cool ocean waves. They fold upon themselves, enclosing deep valleys within their stark contours.”\n“The Atlas is inhabited by #bold Berbers and Arabs#!; whenever you see a mountain, you can be certain that an Arab tribe is hidden within its mysterious bends and folds. When come upon a plain, you can anticipate Berber camps appearing soon on the horizon.\nI am convinced that the Berbers’ #bold religious beliefs#! are very lukewarm. They are a dull and selfish people, far more concerned with this world than the next. #bold They are defeated more easily with our luxury and our arts than with our cannons.#!”\n“Furthermore, the Arabs of the African coast have many vices: like all semi-wild nations, they #bold regard power and strength#! as the ultimate virtues. They disregard human life, #bold despise commerce and art#!, and #bold love war and tumult#! most of all; they are arrogant, credulous, occasionally falling into thoughtless fervor, at other times excessive dejection; their actions are often excessive, always tending more toward feeling than thinking.\nIn summary, gentlemen, I have shown you what Algiers was #bold before our conquest#!... I have much more to tell you about the Arabs; however, I must limit myself, as the constraints of this journal compel me to do so.”"
    joi_flavor_fra.3.a: "The government will deliberate on this matter."

    #African War Hero
    joi_flavor_fra.4.t: "The War Heroes of Africa"
    joi_flavor_fra.4.d: "Soldiers who fought in Africa have returned to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], receiving a hero’s warmest welcome."
    joi_flavor_fra.4.f: "“Mom! What are those marching groups?”\n“They’re French soldiers, my child. They’re Napoleon’s soldiers.”\n“Who’s Napoleon?”\n“He’s our emperor, our greatest general...probably. The British and Austrians joined forces with the Russians and Swedes to invade us...We had to fight back, my child.”\n“Oh! Why did they invade us?”\n“Our homeland...they wanted to destroy our country; they came to burn, kill, and loot, attacking us without reaspm... They are all bad people.”\n“Really?”\n“Yes, dear...Your Papa is also in that group. Can you see him? He’s waving at you!”\n“Father! Father!”\n“Your Papa has to go...But I so wish much he could stay...”"
    joi_flavor_fra.4.a: "Invite him to Paris!"
    joi_flavor_fra.4.b: "Let him retire peacefully."

    #Tunisia: Captain’s Diary
    joi_flavor_fra.5.t: "A Lieutenant"
    joi_flavor_fra.5.d: "Through countless battles and struggles, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] finally conquered the city of Tunis, raising the French flag above its walls."
    joi_flavor_fra.5.f: "“What troubled him was his appearance. Becoming a #bold real infantryman#!, adorned with ribbons and crosses, wearing the #bold Grand Army's uniform#!—all of that was fine, but he still had to prove he was #bold not a rustic bumpkin#!. On the train, he thought of everything his poverty could allow. The carriage took him to Peace Street. It was late, and he forced his way into the Chavet shop just before the door closed.\n‘I need a shirt,’ he said, his face still bearing the #bold joyfully rough air#! he'd acquired in a nearby tavern.\n‘We don’t have ready-made shirts, Sir,’ replied Mr. Chavet, respecting the soldier while worrying about the social rank possibly hidden by the uniform.\nVinganlen blushed. Of course, this was his first time entering such a place: he’d heard about it from old officers on the train.\nMr. Chavet showed disappointment but pitied him, saying: ‘Listen, Monsieur Robert. A customer left an order here... He suddenly had to go to America on a mission... If these shirts fit you...’\nVinganlen was delighted to see items chosen by a man undoubtedly of fine taste: #bold the shirts were made of exquisite blue fabric#!. Vinganlen placed his hands on them, admiring their insignias. ‘But do they fit, sir? I fear the sleeves...’\nSo mesmerized by the beautiful color and fabric, Vinganlen’s #bold desires were stirred#!, and he could hardly believe himself.\n‘Yes, they will.’\nOn the street, Vinganlen looked around, his face glowing with a victorious smile: such a #bold tall, light-footed infantryman#! wearing a heavy hat, savoring the warmth, fragrant atmosphere, and softness of the shirt.”"
    joi_flavor_fra.5.a: "Congratulate our brave soldier!"

    #Morocco: Captain’s Diary
    joi_flavor_fra.6.t: "A Miserable Ship"
    joi_flavor_fra.6.d: "After a series of battles and struggles, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] successfully conquered Meknes, Morocco’s capital, raising the French flag over the city."
    joi_flavor_fra.6.f: "My dear Uncle Biggs,\n\nI feel like writing, so I’m taking the chance to send you a few words to let you know how I am, while hoping that someday I might be fortunate enough to receive a letter from you. I would be greatly interested in your reply, as I haven’t seen or heard from anyone for over six months here in Meknes.\n\nI left Toulon on March 16, aboard the Thetis, traveling past Majorca and Oran. That part of the trip was pleasant, with good accommodations for a warship, and we bathed every day. But good things rarely last—we ultimately had to board the dreadful Alsun, enduring four weeks of misery. The ship was horrible (ridden with lice), and we had to endure shirt inspections daily. The food was poor and sparse, and the mess hall was worse. I was glad to reach Casablanca and step off such a dilapidated vessel. During those four weeks, I lost a considerable amount of weight.\nHere, most of the work is done by native women, which seems strange, as the men don’t do much; Sunday feels like any other day for them because they have their own religious holidays. Turkish tobacco cigars are sold for 11 sous per 100, and they are quite good.\nThe place has a few hotels and one Italian restaurant, but otherwise, it’s very much like Algiers—dirty as ever.\nWe don’t receive much mail here due to great uncertainty about deliveries, and we never know when the next letter will arrive.\nIt’s not exactly the place I would choose, but of course, I had no choice.\nWishing you the best; missing you,\nYour nephew: Robert Joseph Jean-Vinganlen"
    joi_flavor_fra.6.a: "Perhaps the environment needs improvement."

    #Sahara: Vinganlen's Diary
    joi_flavor_fra.7.t: "Complaints About the Desert"
    joi_flavor_fra.7.d: "Through countless battles and struggles, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] successfully expanded its territory into the vast Sahara Desert."
    joi_flavor_fra.7.f: "Dear Mother,\n\nThank you very much for your long and interesting letter. Please don’t worry—I will write more comprehensively at a more appropriate time.\n\nAs you can see from the address above, I have left Biskra. Our regiment departed the Sahara border in January, where winter was exceptionally cold. After three days of train travel from Bona, followed by three days of pleasant sailing, we landed in Ajaccio, joining part of the 7th Division. I had commanded a strong detachment stationed in the desert, near natives who often harassed us, though without causing material loss. After the cold desert winter, the scorching heat became unbearable, with blazing sunlight, endless sand, and countless tormenting flies. Life here is very different from Marseille. I never imagined myself riding a camel through the Sahara Desert. I am happy to say I am very healthy and will be glad when this struggle ends, knowing I am among those fortunate enough to return home safely.\n\nAlso, I have been promoted; you need not worry about me.\n\nI trust you are well.\n\nPlease give my best wishes and kind regards to my sister.\n\nYour most loving son,\nRobert"
    joi_flavor_fra.7.a: "Let him rest for a while."

    #Core North Africa
    joi_flavor_fra.8.t: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]'s Proposal"
    joi_flavor_fra.8.d: "With the overseas territories of North Africa brought under Paris' direct administration, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle][ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] envisioned a plan to make North Africa legally an integral part of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
    joi_flavor_fra.8.f: "All who do not accept our conditions must be plundered. Everything must be taken or destroyed, regardless of age or gender: wherever the French army steps, nothing must grow again.\nRegardless of what our philanthropists say, whoever seeks a goal must seek the means. I personally warn all the excellent soldiers I have the privilege to command that if they happen to bring me a living Arab, they will be punished with the flat of the sword...\nMy dear friends, we must wage war on the Arabs in this way: kill all men over fifteen, take all their women and children, place them on naval ships, and send them to the Marquesas Islands or elsewhere.\nIn short, eliminate anything that refuses to crawl at our feet like a dog."
    joi_flavor_fra.8.a: "France's homeland should always focus on Europe."
    joi_flavor_fra.8.b: "Who dares say Algiers is not part of France?!"

    #West Africa: Vinganlen's Diary

    joi_flavor_fra.9.d: "Through countless battles and struggles, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] successfully expanded its territory into the fertile plains of West Africa."
    joi_flavor_fra.9.f: "Dear Anna,\n\nI’m sorry for the delay in replying to your letter, but I’ve been busy recently, so I hope you don’t mind. Since I don’t have access to my gear right now, I can only write you a short note because I’m almost out of stationery and envelopes, meaning I’ll need to make up for it next time.\n\nI received your previous budget after I sent you a postcard. I’m sure you spent a lot of time writing all those uppercase letters on the paper, but I enjoyed reading them very much because here I find it hard to write an interesting letter. I fear my letters must often bore you, but I’ve carefully read your news, noting everything about the office and our overseas friends. One highlight was about poor old Lippington—it’s the first time I’ve heard of him, poor fellow.\nI sincerely hope our friends still in the desert survive this terrible ordeal safely. I noticed Andre Koning and several brothers have gone, which saddens me.\nNow I must finish, Anna, because the page is nearly full. I hope you won’t mind, and please remember to convey my best wishes to everyone at home and to all our inquiring friends...\nYours sincerely,\nVinganlen"

    joi_flavor_fra.10.t: "A Letter Sent"
    joi_flavor_fra.10.d: "Through countless battles and struggles, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] successfully expanded its territory into Mauritania's deserts."
    joi_flavor_fra.10.f: "Dear Anna,\n\nJust a few lines to let you know how we’re doing here. I can’t recall the last time I wrote to you or what I shared. A few days after returning from leave, we were ordered to march along the Niger River to Niamey, where numerous native tribes gathered, with similar numbers further on at Maradi. You know, the Sahara is a cruel place, with nothing but sand, sand, and more sand. We spent weeks there, walking every day—it was absolute endurance training. The heat was intense, marching dozens of miles daily, with all transport relying on mules and camels to navigate rocky passes. During one encampment, we encountered bad water, with around forty comrades falling ill with typhoid fever—seven died, but the rest fortunately survived.\n\nDespite the hardships, after temporarily stabilizing the situation in Mauritania, we returned safely to Saint-Louis.\n\nPlease send my warm greetings to Father and Mother. I trust all of you are in good health, and we’ll meet again in a few months.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nYours most sincerely,\nRobert Vinganlen"
    joi_flavor_fra.10.a: "Hopefully, they can reunite."

    joi_flavor_fra.11.d: "Through countless battles and struggles, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] successfully expanded its territory to the shores of Lake Chad."
    joi_flavor_fra.11.f: "Dear Mother,\n\nMy address indicates that I am well. Oh, it’s a different life—initially harsh, with four blankets on the floor as bedding, very hard. I only adjusted last night, my first good night of rest. The food is decent, but the service is rough. Of course, the weather is terrible, but my circumstances remain the same as when I left. I have no means to manage my hair as you suggested, and my collar is as grimy as the office grille. I had a slight cough last Thursday, but I’m alright now.\nI forgot to tell you that upon arrival, we were assigned different tents. Mine is quite nice, very comfortable—definitely better accommodations than the camp, so you need not worry. I share it with three officers from Lyon and Brittany, all excellent fellows. One of them even knows the director from my academy. I must say, they are extremely kind to me—more helpful than some of our own. It’s surprising.\n\nWell, I’ll bid you goodbye for now. I often think of our times in town together, as well as the fields and meadows of our little village in Marseille. It all feels so long ago. I only hope to return again. But this is what must be done; one can only hope the end comes soon.\n\nYour most loving son,\nRobert"
    joi_flavor_fra.11.a: "May he return home soon."

    #West African Administrative Division
    joi_flavor_fra.12.t: "Establishment of the West African Overseas Administrative Division"
    joi_flavor_fra.12.d: "With West Africa’s overseas provinces brought under Paris' direct administration, a new management system was established to serve the interests of both France and the local populations."
    joi_flavor_fra.12.f: "Sir, I urge you to imagine these agile and resilient sons of the desert, entangled in the myriad bureaucratic procedures of our administration, compelled to bow to the slowness, regularity, details, and precision of our centralized governance. The country’s old government relied solely on yataghans and clubs for maintaining order. Everything else has now become French.\nAfter 300 years of Arab conquest, Africans had entirely lost the habit of self-governance. The most outstanding individuals were excluded from public affairs out of the conquerors' jealousy. The old government was abominable, which is why the new French administration must serve as the sole link uniting various peoples—a convergence of many distinct lights."
    joi_flavor_fra.12.a: "Let us congratulate West Africa's officials and soldiers!"

    joi_flavor_fra.14.d: "The Congo and equatorial rainforests finally yielded under [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s march, with the French flag planted firmly across this vast dark continent."
    joi_flavor_fra.14.f: "My dear Mother,\n\nOur unit just endured an especially horrific period. Wednesday night, we entered the trenches. By Sunday morning at 5 a.m., our artillery began bombarding the enemy city, and 20 minutes later, we crossed their walls. My God, what a welcoming the Congolese had prepared for us—they somehow gathered so many guns, firing wildly! From what I understand, the British might have been involved.\nIt was terrible, seeing my soldiers go to their deaths. Knowing every man personally only made it worse. In truth, calling them men is wrong—they were mostly just boys, much like I was before.\n\nThey say the wicked find no rest, and if that’s true, then surely I must be a bad person.\n\nWith love from your devoted son,\nRobert Vinganlen"

    #Central African Administrative Division

    joi_flavor_fra.15.d: "With Central Africa's overseas provinces brought under Paris' direct administration, a new management system was established to ensure France's absolute authority in the region."
    joi_flavor_fra.15.f: "Sir, you might recall my earlier remarks—throughout the regency, both civil and military governance rested in the hands of local individuals. When we became masters of Equatorial Africa, we immediately summoned all remaining chiefs, from the Sultan down to the last soldier in his militia, and transported them to the Asian coast.\nTo better erase traces of enemy rule, we began tearing up or burning all written documents and administrative records, whether real or fabricated, that might have left a trace before us.\nConquest heralds a new era. To prevent an irrational blend of past and present, we even destroyed large parts of their town streets to rebuild them in our manner, assigning French names to all those allowed to remain.\nMany native rainforests dwellers accepted our direct governance, which I firmly believe was necessary."
    joi_flavor_fra.15.a: "Excellent work!"

    #Overseas Provinces Federalization?
    joi_flavor_fra.16.t: "Federalization of Overseas Provinces?"
    joi_flavor_fra.16.d: "A bill regarding the exercise of political rights and the acquisition of citizenship for French subjects in the overseas provinces of French Africa was proposed in the name of His Excellency [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], by the Governor of Algiers, the Governor of Senegal, the Governor of Niger, and the Governor of Congo."
    joi_flavor_fra.16.f: "#bold Gentlemen#!, the Parliament in Algiers had once organized a #bold naturalization process#! for Muslim locals, which, upon completion, granted them #bold all legislative benefits applicable to citizens of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]#! and, in most cases, extended ordinary laws to children born to naturalized citizens. To that end, simplified procedures have been introduced within our African federalization legislation, crafted in accordance with the wishes of French Muslims.\n\nThe Civil Code impacts all aspects of naturalization. Experience shows that #bold it is no longer feasible to continue treating a vast number of Africans under French governance as subjects deprived of basic political rights#!. They have fully assimilated French ideas, yet due to familial or religious reasons, cannot relinquish their personal status. It is now unjust to deny the exercise of political rights to the most advanced individuals or those offering significant guarantees of loyalty. It must be emphasized that granting these rights to African locals is not an innovation. On the contrary, we are merely adhering to precedents set in other overseas provinces: #bold placing loyal locals of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and their descendants under the legal system#!, granting them citizenship, particularly voting rights, while maintaining their private legal status and prescribing corresponding military obligations.\n\nGiven the current circumstances, it is indeed impossible to delay initiating this necessary assimilation process, which is critical to the #bold moral health#! of the major overseas provinces of French Africa."
    joi_flavor_fra.16.a: "France must unify under one flag as a single entity—it is time to openly acknowledge this, as long as we can dispel fears of division."
    joi_flavor_fra.16.b: "The nation must prevent this absurd act that would tarnish France forever!"

    joi_flavor_fra.17.f: "For centuries, France has sought eastern allies to balance its continental enemies. In the 12th century, we forged a friendship with Scotland to counter England; in the 16th century, we entered the profane alliance with Turkey to oppose Austria... For the national interest of our country, it is geopolitically pragmatic to set aside ideological and historical conflicts and form a new alliance with Russia in the East to address the immense, undeniable security threat posed by the nascent [SCOPE.sCountry('GER_scope').GetName], as well as its potentially unbearable consequences."

    joi_flavor_fra.18.f: "Since the Anti-French Coalition, the diplomatic strategy of maintaining a balance in the German region has collapsed. However, a friendship with a powerful nation in Western Europe might bring substantial benefits to our country, especially geopolitically. The past enmity between [SCOPE.sCountry('FRA_scope').GetName] and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is, after all, history, and history should not hinder realpolitik.

Four high pillars rise on either side of the bridge, each 17 meters tall, crowned with gilded bronze statues symbolizing ‘Science’ and ‘Art,’ ‘Dueling’ and ‘War.’ This bridge is a gift from our ally [SCOPE.sCountry('RUS_scope').GetName] to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName].

    joi_flavor_fra.25.t: "Pelletier and Caventou"
    joi_flavor_fra.25.d: "Two outstanding chemists from Paris, Pierre Joseph Pelletier and Joseph Bienaimé Caventou, synthesized a new substance in their laboratory, which they named quinine."
    joi_flavor_fra.25.f: "“This substance originates from the bark of a tree we procured from Bolivia in South America. The Incas once referred to it as the Sacred Tree—and rightly so! In some cases, this can be achieved by synthesizing the natural product itself and comparing it with the real natural sample; thus, synthetic completion is often a pragmatic necessity. However, with this drug, we will no longer fear the dreadful malaria of Africa.”"
    joi_flavor_fra.25.a: "A great invention!"

I can’t believe this is true; has God blessed me so immensely, allowing me to leave this impoverished, desolate place and go to Paris, a city said to be paved with gold?!”"
    joi_flavor_fra.26.a: "Yes, fortunate young man!"
