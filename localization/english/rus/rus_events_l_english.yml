Engage in all possible European affairs and discussions, particularly those related to Germanic matters.\n4. Divide Poland to maintain perpetual turmoil and mutual distrust within the Polish kingdom; influence Polish court assemblies with gold, buying them to gain advantages in kingly elections.\n5. Seize as much land from [SCOPE.sCountry('SWE_scope').GetName] as possible and provoke its attack against us to justify conquering Sweden; isolate Denmark from Sweden and escalate conflicts between them.\n6. Always choose German princesses as spouses for our princes to enhance familial ties and secure German support for our expansion endeavors.\n7. Prioritize alliances and commerce with [SCOPE.sCountry('GBR_scope').GetName], establishing continuous exchanges of goods and sailors to benefit our navigation and trade.\n8. Expand northward along the Baltic Sea and southward along the Black Sea.\n9. Get as close as possible to Constantinople and India, as whoever rules there becomes the true master of the world; thus, initiate frontier wars not only in Turkey but also in Persia.\nAfter #bold dismantling Sweden, destroying Persia, subduing Poland, and conquering Turkey#!, our armies will have united, with ships guarding the Black Sea and Baltic Sea. Subsequently, we must secretly approach Versailles Palace and the Vienna Court with proposals to share a global empire.\n\nWe must #bold provoke disputes between them to weaken each other#!.

We did not expect war; we believed they would accept our demands without forcing war...\n#bold People often ask#! whether we are legally or morally entitled to act against Northern Europe.

[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has achieved peace, albeit an extremely harsh and precarious peace, enabling us for a time to concentrate our efforts on the most vital and challenging aspect of the socialist revolution. The principal task of the proletariat and the impoverished peasants it leads is to engage in active, or rather creative, work: establishing a highly intricate and precise new organizational system for the planned production and distribution of products vital to the survival of millions!\nThis revolution can only proceed smoothly under conditions where the majority of the population, especially the laboring masses, engage in independent historical creativity. Socialism's success is guaranteed only if the proletariat and poor peasants demonstrate full consciousness, intellectual strength, determination, and selflessness.\""
    joi_flavor_rus.30.a: "Let them go and contribute to socialist construction."
    joi_flavor_rus.30.b: "We must prioritize purging these traitors to solidify the Soviet dictatorship!"

    # Ukrainian Famine
    joi_flavor_rus.31.t: "Ukrainian Famine!"
    joi_flavor_rus.31.d: "The harsh policy of collective agriculture's excess grain requisitioning combined with a sweeping drought across Russia devastated agricultural production in Ukraine, leading to a horrifying famine that especially ravaged the region."
    joi_flavor_rus.31.f: "The terrible crop failures and severe famine have struck the most fertile black soil regions of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. Starvation, cold, and terror grip the land while [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName]'s Soviet government seems oblivious, continuing to requisition vast amounts of grain. Farmers' homes, livestock, poultry, and even household items like stoves, teapots, and buckets were nationalized. Armed requisition squads equipped with poison gas and machine guns suppressed any farmers unwilling to surrender their grain, branding them as 'anti-socialist kulaks.' Millions of tons of grain were transported away, cutting off Ukraine and the Don River region from the outside world. Any famine-stricken individuals attempting to leave Ukraine without permission were arrested as 'class enemies.' Ukrainian Soviets pleaded with Moscow to lower requisition quotas and leave farmers enough seed and food, but their appeals were mercilessly denied by [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName][ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle]."
    joi_flavor_rus.31.a: "What nonsense is this anti-Soviet rhetoric?!"

    # Lenin in October
    joi_flavor_rus.32.t: "Lenin in October"
    joi_flavor_rus.32.d: "Vladimir Lenin, leader of the underground Bolshevik Party during the Tsarist era of the Russian Empire, returned to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] by rail from Germany following the Communist revolution and became the leader of the uprising."
    joi_flavor_rus.32.f: "\"I received a slip of paper, comrades, and I shall read it aloud: 'Your government cannot last; your skin shall be made into drums.'\nI see this was not written by a worker’s hand. I doubt the author has the courage to stand here before us.\nComrades! I suspect they dare not try; comrades! When a revolution is underway—when an entire class is perishing—it is utterly unlike the death of one individual. #bold A corpse can be carried out after death, but when the old society dies, alas, the bourgeois corpse cannot simply be nailed into a coffin and buried!#!\nThe bourgeois corpse decays within us, spreading its toxic fumes, filling the air with its stench!\nTraitors judged by the people’s will must be mercilessly eradicated.\nLet the bourgeoisie go mad! Let those with hollow souls weep!\nComrades, our answer is this: triple our vigilance, remain steadfast and patient;\nhold your positions. Comrades, remember: #bold there is only one path—victory; the only alternative is death!#!"
    joi_flavor_rus.32.a: "Death does not belong to the working class!"

    # Abolition of the Mir System
    joi_flavor_rus.33.t: "Abolition of the Mir System"
    joi_flavor_rus.33.d: "The #variable mir system#! was abolished under the direction of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle][ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]. Countless lands were reorganized, and the current government is already debating the question of new land ownership..."
    joi_flavor_rus.33.f: "\"By the sweat of your brow you shall eat bread... until you return to the ground; for out of it you were taken... for dust you are, and to dust you shall return.\"\nThe decaying mir system once weighed heavily upon our people, leaving everyone gasping for air. No one believed it possible to eliminate this centuries-old institution, but we did it. Now [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has, like King David, utterly vanquished the giant obstructing our path.\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]’s farmlands shall flourish once more. Impoverished farmers have gained their land. The government might encourage wealthy landowners in Eastern Europe to expand their holdings, utilizing advanced tools and fertilizers to extract tremendous wealth; or it might distribute these lands evenly at low prices to the impoverished farmers who once owned them."
    joi_flavor_rus.33.a: "Let us resell the land to the peasants."
    joi_flavor_rus.33.b: "Let us fully privatize the land!"
    
    # Mongolian Referendum
    joi_flavor_rus.34.t: "Mongolian Referendum"
    joi_flavor_rus.34.d: "The referendum ballots from the Mongolian administrative district have been delivered to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle][ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName]. The world is watching this referendum closely, and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] is also uncertain about Mongolia's fate."
    joi_flavor_rus.34.f: "\"To be frank, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s desire for Outer Mongolia is entirely based on military strategic considerations for this region.\"\n\n\"Our citizens would certainly not forgive us under such circumstances, and they would rise against the government.\"\n\n\"If your country had the strength to defeat enemies on its own, I would not make such a demand; today, you do not possess this strength, and to make such statements is equivalent to nonsense!\"\n\n\"Given Outer Mongolia's repeated expression of its desire for independence, [SCOPE.sCountry('CHI_scope').GetName]'s government declares that if the citizens of Outer Mongolia confirm this desire through a referendum, [SCOPE.sCountry('CHI_scope').GetName]'s government will recognize Outer Mongolia's independence, using its current boundaries as its borders.\""
    joi_flavor_rus.34.a: "The ballot in favor of joining [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] won by a margin of 88.48%; Mongolia belongs to Russia!"
    joi_flavor_rus.34.b: "The ballot in support of independence won by a margin of 97%; Mongolia will become an independent nation!"
