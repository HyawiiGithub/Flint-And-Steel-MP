MPBE, or Multiplayer Balance & Essentials Mod, focusses on multiplayer balancing with campaigns up to 1900 and beyond. It also includes a number of useful tools specifically for multiplayer. 
Constant feedback and collaboration with several other players from multiplayer servers helps to further develop the modpack and also to fix or improve weaknesses in vanilla.
